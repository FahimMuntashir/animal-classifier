## 📌 Project Overview  
This project involves creating a **custom image classification dataset** featuring **five animal classes**:  
🐶 **Dog** | 🐄 **Cow** | 🐱 **Cat** | 🐑 **Lamb** | 🦓 **Zebra**  

We collected **100 images per class** from online sources and personal captures, processed them, and developed a **CNN model** to classify these animals with an accuracy target of **90%+**.

---

## 📂 Dataset Details  
- **Total Images:** **500** (100 per class).  
- **Sources:** Google Images, Unsplash, personal phone captures.  
- **Preprocessing Applied:**  
  - **Resized** → Standardized to **224×224** pixels.  
  - **Normalized** → Scaled pixel values to **[0,1]**.  
  - **Augmented** → Applied **rotation, flipping, cropping** to improve model generalization.  

---

## ⚙️ Model Architecture & Tools  
The model is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed for multi-class classification.  

### **🔧 Libraries Used:**  
- **TensorFlow/Keras** → Model Training  
- **OpenCV** → Image Preprocessing  
- **NumPy & Pandas** → Data Handling  

### **🔍 Model Development Process:**  
1. **Simple CNN Model:** Trained with **500 images** (initial accuracy ~85%).  
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing **learning rate, batch size, epochs**.  
3. **Transfer Learning (Next Step):** Testing with **pre-trained models** (VGG16, ResNet) for better performance.
